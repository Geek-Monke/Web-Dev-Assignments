            <p>2023 is shaping up to be an enormous year for video games, with many titles previously planned for this year getting pushed into next. Big-name games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 are coming in 2023, as are several high-profile remakes of classic games.It can be a lot to keep track of, so we rounded up every game planned for release in 2023, splitting them into sections by month--as well as undated 2023 games--right here. Each game listing also shows supported platforms so you can figure out just what you're going to buy this year. As more games are announced and given release dates, this list will be further updated, and we'll also continue to adjust it if games are delayed, perhaps into 2024.</p>
